Sometimes, you want to filter out files in a glob!
Luckily, `[]` helps you do just this. If the first character in the brackets is a `!` or (in newer versions of bash) a `^`, the glob inverts, and that bracket expression matches characters that _aren't_ listed.
For example:

```console
hacker@dojo:~$ touch file_a
hacker@dojo:~$ touch file_b
hacker@dojo:~$ touch file_c
hacker@dojo:~$ ls
file_a	file_b	file_c
hacker@dojo:~$ echo Look: file_[!ab]
Look: file_c
hacker@dojo:~$ echo Look: file_[^ab]
Look: file_c
hacker@dojo:~$ echo Look: file_[ab]
Look: file_a file_b
```

Armed with this knowledge, go forth to `/challenge/files` and run `/challenge/run` with all files that don't start with `p`, `w`, or `n`!

**NOTE:** The `!` character has a different special meaning in bash when it's not the first character of a `[]` glob, so keep that in mind if things stop making sense! `^` does not have this problem, but it is also not compatible with older shells.
