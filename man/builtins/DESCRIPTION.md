Some commands, rather than being programs with man pages and help options, are built into the shell itself.
These are called *builtins*.
Builtins are invoked just like commands, but the shell handles them internally instead of launching other programs.
You can get a list of shell builtins by running the *builtin* `help`, as shown:

```console
hacker@dojo:~$ help
```

You can get help on a specific one by passing it to the `help` builtin.
Let's look at a builtin that we've already used earlier, `cd`!

```console
hacker@dojo:~$ help cd
cd: cd [-L|[-P [-e]] [-@]] [dir]
    Change the shell working directory.
    
    Change the current directory to DIR.  The default DIR is the value of the
    HOME shell variable.
...
```

Some good information:
In this challenge, we'll practice using `help` to look up help for builtins.
This challenge's `challenge` command is a shell builtin, rather than a program.
Like before, you need to look up its help to figure out the secret value to pass to it!
