Some programs don't have a man page, but they might tell you how to run them if invoked with a special argument.
Usually, this argument is `--help`, but it can often be `-h` or, in rare cases, `-?`, `help`, or other esoteric values like `/?` (though the latter is more frequently encountered on Windows).

In this level, you will practice reading a program's documentation with `--help`.
