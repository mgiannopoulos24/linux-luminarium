This level is tricky: it hides the manpage for the challenge by randomizing its name.
Fortunately, all man pages are centralized in a searchable database. This means you can search the manpage database to locate the hidden `challenge` man page!
To learn how to search for the correct man page, read the `man` page itself by running: `man man`!

**HINT 1:** The `man man` command teaches advanced usage of the `man` command. You'll need this knowledge to find the hidden manpage that explains how to use `/challenge/challenge` to obtain the flag.

**HINT 2:** Despite the randomized name, you'll still use `/challenge/challenge`to achieve your flag!
