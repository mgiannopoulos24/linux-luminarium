While many view shells as simple wrappers around useful utilities, this perspective can underestimate the shell's power. Neglecting its capabilities can limit your ability to accomplish complex tasks in Linux. In this module, we will explore using the _shell_ itself, beyond relying solely on command-line tools.

Some questions we will delve into include:

- How can you print out a file without using `cat`, `more`, or similar commands?
- How do you perform mathematical calculations and number base conversions, especially useful for tasks like raw memory operations and hacking?
- How can you implement complex functionality directly within your shell?

We'll uncover how to leverage the shell's built-in functionalities, such as builtins and other powerful features.

Let's dive in and discover the capabilities of the shell!
