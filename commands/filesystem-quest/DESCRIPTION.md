With your understanding of `cd`, `ls`, and `cat`, we're ready to embark on a little game!

Let's start at the root directory `/`.

```console
hacker@dojo:~$ cd /
hacker@dojo:/$ ls
bin   challenge  etc   home  lib32  libx32  mnt  proc  run   srv  tmp  var
boot  dev        flag  lib   lib64  media   opt  root  sbin  sys  usr
```

That's quite a lot to explore! Eventually, you'll become familiar with all these directories, but for now, focus on finding the `flag` file and the `challenge` directory.

In this challenge, I've hidden the flag somewhere within this labyrinth!
You'll use `ls` and `cat` to follow my clues and uncover it. Here's how it'll unfold:

1. Start at `/` and use `ls` to explore.
2. Look for a file named HINT, CLUE, or something similar.
3. Use `cat` to read the contents of that file for your first clue.
4. Depending on the clue, decide whether to navigate to the next directory or stay put.
5. Continue following the clues until you discover the flag!

Best of luck!
