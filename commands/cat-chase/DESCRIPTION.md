You can specify various paths as arguments to commands, and we'll practice this further with `cat`.
In this challenge, I'll place the flag in a complex directory structure, and you won't be allowed to change directories using `cd`, so `cat flag` won't work.
You must retrieve the flag using its absolute path, regardless of where it is located.
