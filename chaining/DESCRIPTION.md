In the piping module, you explored how multiple commands can be connected together using pipes to achieve complex tasks that individual commands cannot accomplish alone. Beyond just data transfer, this concept extends to running several commands in sequence to achieve cumulative effects.

This module will explore various methods of chaining commands together, aside from piping. By the end, you'll be equipped to start writing your own _shell_ scripts!
